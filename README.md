- Create and build a webpage with a GIPHY search engine that allows the user to submit a word then responses with Gifs that correspond to that certain keyword.
- The webpage contains a search bar underneath a header nav bar. This search bar will function to allow the user to enter any keyword. The API will then respond with gifs that fit the description in the search bar.
- Technologies: Visual Code, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Also used CodePen.io for testing purposes.
- For future improvement, I'd like to make it to where you can select each of the gifs and it blows up to fit the screen with a share icon to make it easier to connect with friends.

  
User Stories:
1) As a user, I want to be able to quick find the search bar and that is accessible to me to use.
2) As a user, I want to be able to scroll down the list of gifs and highlight the one I am seeing.
3) As a user, I want to be able to quickly jump up the page back to the scroll bar to search for more items.
